Definitions:

    Client: a person, company, or entity that uses a product or service provided by another person, company, or entity.

    Licensee: a person, company, or entity that is granted the right to use a software product or service in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in a licensing agreement.

    Source Code: the programming instructions that make up a software application. It is used by developers to create, modify, and maintain software.

    Plugin/Addin: a software component that adds specific functionality to an existing software application.

    FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software): software that is both free as in freedom and free as in price.

    FLOSH (Free/Libre and Open Source Hardware): hardware that is both free as in freedom and free as in price.

    Open source compliance plugin connector: a software component that allows the use of open source plugins or extensions

    Standard plugin system: a software architecture that allows developers to extend the functionality of a software application by adding plugins or extensions.


Permission to use the software/hardware product/component and/or source code is only granted to clients who have signed a contract and made a verified payment.

To ensure compliance with our licensing agreement, any person who acquires a copy of the software/hardware product/component and/or source code 
must do so with proper authorization. Any unauthorized acquisition or use of our software/hardware product/component and/or source code is a violation of our licensing agreement. 
Proper authorization refers to obtaining the software/hardware product/component and/or source code legally through the purchase 
of a valid license or by obtaining written permission from the copyright holder.

Clients who have obtained legally authorized access are permitted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, 
and/or sell copies of the software/hardware product/component and/or source code, subject to the terms and conditions of the licensing agreement:

I. Entry Point Applications/Components (OPEN Source, Third Party FLOSS):
The software/hardware may serve as an entry point application, 
implying that it can be used as a starting point for software/hardware systems, but not as the complete system, while using FLOSS/FLOSH.

II. Paid Source Independent Application Base Platforms (PAID Source, Original Developer/Creator):
Any modifications made to the software/hardware by the original developer shall be developed within paid source-independent application platforms, 
that work together with their specific entry point application. This ensures that commercial paid source is clearly separated from FLOSS.

III. Plugins:
Developers can create plugins using any programming language or development tool they prefer.

IIIa. Open Source Plugins (OPEN Source, All Developers):

If the Add-In/Plugin content is open sourced, 
any developer can create and distribute open source plugins that comply with the license terms. 
1. The open source plugin can be executed using the open source compliance plugin connector, 
    which ensures that no other components of the application will be affected by FLOSS licenses. 
2. Alternatively, the standard plugin system can be used with the open source layer option, 
    which provides a this license as a single license for the entire application.

Benefits:
    Any developer can contribute to the community by creating and sharing plugins that comply with the license terms.
    The open source plugin connector ensures that the application remains compliant with FLOSS licenses.
    The standard plugin system with the open source layer option provides a single license for the entire application, simplifying licensing and compliance for the end user.


IIIb. Closed Source local Private/Company Plugins (All Developers):

For Closed Source local Private/Company Plugins, only developers within a client or a clients customer company or organization can access and modify the source code. 
This approach ensures that proprietary code remains within that company and does not get exposed to external parties.

The plugins can be integrated into the system through a proprietary plugin connector, which ensures that no other components of the system get impacted by external licenses.

Benefits:
    By using Closed Source local Private/Company Plugins, 
    developers can maintain full control over the code, ensuring that it is tailored to the specific needs of the organization. 
    Additionally, the plugins can be kept private, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or theft of intellectual property.

Overall, Closed Source local Private/Company Plugins provide a secure and flexible solution for companies looking to develop and integrate proprietary code into their systems.


IIIc. Paid Source / Closed Source Plugins (PAID/CLOSED Source, Verified Partner Developer):

If the Add-In/Plugin content is not open sourced, a verified partner developer may offer it as a paid source/closed source plugin for the standard plugin system. 
This approach ensures that the code and intellectual property remains with the verified partner developer, 
and is not subject to open source licenses. 
The plugin can be distributed and used within the application according to the terms of the license agreement between the verified partner developer and the end user.

Benefits:
    The verified partner developers can retain ownership of their code and intellectual property, 
    and have control over its distribution and use.
    The end user can benefit from the features and functionality provided by the paid source/closed source plugin, 
    without the need to comply with open source licenses of a different plugin, which he might therefore not use.
    The paid source/closed source plugin can be updated and maintained by the verified partner developer, 
    ensuring ongoing compatibility and support.
